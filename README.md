## ü§î How Does It Work?

Unlike traditional GCS software, Canary Ground Control is a web-based application that runs on a Raspberry Pi--making it a part of the flight stack. This enables you to manage your autopilot from anywhere in the world, as long as you have an internet connection.

## ‚ùì Why Not Just Use Mission Planner, QGC, or APM Planner ‚Äî with Tailscale?

You might ask:
‚ÄúWhy not just run an existing GCS (Mission Planner, QGC, APM Planner), and connect over Tailscale ‚Äî either from a laptop, or running the GCS directly on the Raspberry Pi?‚Äù

> **TL;DR:**
> Traditional GCS software is designed for *desktop-based, short-range* semi-manual operation.
> CanaryGC is purpose-built for *embedded, LTE-connected, persistent, remote UAV control* ‚Äî where every watt and packet counts.

### Running GCS on a laptop (with Tailscale to the drone):

1. **No Always-On Link**
   The GCS must be running on your laptop. If your laptop disconnects (or sleeps), telemetry is lost.
   CanaryGC runs *on the drone itself* ‚Äî providing a persistent link, always available to any browser.

2. **Laptop Required**
   You must boot a laptop and connect Tailscale. CanaryGC works from any phone, tablet, or computer ‚Äî no special software needed.

3. **Tailscale Reliability**
   VPN tunnels can be fragile over LTE or CG-NAT. CanaryGC supports public-IP SIMs or static tunnels with no VPN dependency.

### Running GCS **directly on the Pi** (with Tailscale + VNC / RDP):

1. **GUI Overhead**
   Traditional GCS software (QGC, Mission Planner, APM Planner) is designed as a desktop GUI app (Qt/X11). Running it on the Pi requires installing and running a full desktop environment (X11 server, GPU stack, window manager). This adds CPU and memory load, increases system complexity, and draws more power ‚Äî reducing flight time.

2. **Remote Desktop Limitations**
   Accessing the Pi‚Äôs GUI remotely (via Tailscale + VNC/RDP) requires constant encoding and streaming of the desktop image ‚Äî adding CPU load, using bandwidth, and introducing lag. Over LTE links, this results in poor responsiveness and unreliable control ‚Äî unacceptable for UAV operations.

3. **Battery & Performance Impact**
   The additional CPU/GPU usage from running a desktop GCS and streaming remote sessions directly reduces battery life. It also impacts system responsiveness for other critical tasks (LTE modem handling, telemetry routing, camera streaming).

4. **Reliability Risks**
   Desktop-based GCS apps are not designed for connection interruptions or lossy networks. VNC/RDP sessions can freeze or drop if connectivity is poor. Recovery often requires manual intervention ‚Äî not ideal for autonomous or long-range flights.

5. **Increased Maintenance**
   Installing and maintaining a full desktop stack and GUI-based GCS on the Pi adds software complexity, increases boot time, and introduces more failure points. Field systems should be simple and robust.

### Why CanaryGC‚Äôs Web-Native, Headless Design Is Better

CanaryGC is designed for **headless, remote-first UAV deployments**:

* It runs as a lightweight background service ‚Äî no X11, no desktop.
* The Pi can run a minimal OS, saving power and booting faster.
* Users connect via a web browser ‚Äî no VNC or desktop tunnels needed.
* The Pi streams only telemetry and control data ‚Äî not full-screen images ‚Äî making it far more efficient over LTE links.
* The interface gracefully handles network interruptions and reconnects.
* It works from any device (phone, tablet, laptop) with a browser ‚Äî ideal for field operations.
